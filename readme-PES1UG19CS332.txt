FVAR Assignment - 1

The scene consists of a sphere with 3 objects: cone, cylinder and a tetrahedron moving randomly inside it.
The 3 objects rotate and move randomly inside the sphere.
Every vertex in the model is coloured randomly.

The camera is situated at the circumference of the sphere and can be moved on the circumference 
by using the right click button on the mouse and dragging it to the desired position.

The objects inside the sphere can be selected by a left click of the mouse on the object.

The arrow keys can be used to translate the selected object up and down the y-axis and 
right and left on the x-axis.

The axis of rotation of the selected object can be changed by clicking the x,y,z keys on the keyboard to
change it to the respective axis of rotation.

The object can be scaled up and down in size by clicking on the + and - keys.
The object can be deselected by clicking 'c' on the keyboard.

By clicking on 'w' on the keyboard, we can view the scene from outside through a wired sphere.
The camera can be rotated in this case too.
Clicking on 'w' again reverts back to the previous view.

The scene is accompanied by background music too, for an immersive experience.
